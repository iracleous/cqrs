The Mediator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that simplifies communication between objects by introducing a mediator, which manages the interactions. Instead of objects referring to each other directly, they communicate through the mediator. This decouples the components, reducing dependencies and making the system more flexible and maintainable.

In .NET, MediatR is a popular library that implements the mediator pattern, allowing for decoupled request/response handling in CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) architectures.

With MediatR:
- Requests (e.g., commands, queries) are sent to the Mediator.
- The Mediator finds the appropriate Handler for that request and executes it.
- This pattern is particularly useful for handling things like commands (write operations) and queries (read operations) separately, following CQRS principles.

Key Benefits of MediatR:
- Decouples logic
- Centralized request handling
